title: Matrix

[Matrix](https://matrix.org) is the hub of Federated Nexus, as everything else authenticates against Matrix. This means that when you change your password on Matrix, you'll need to log into everything else with the new password.

## Homeserver

Federated Nexus runs [Grapevine](https://grapevine.computer.surgery/), a fork of [Conduit](https://conduit.rs/), a Rust implementation of the Matrix specification. This means it doesn't quite have all the features of [Synapse](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/), but it's much more performant. Some features that Grapevine lack include:

- Simplified Sliding Sync (SSS): SSS is coming soon, but right now it means you may not be able to use next-gen clients like Element X.
- Rooms older than v6: In Matrix, each "room" (equivalent to a Discord channel) follows a certain version of the matrix spec. The latest room version is v10, and v6 is _very_ old. However, some rooms don't want to upgrade, as the process can be quite painful, so they stay at old versions like v2. With Grapevine, you won't be able to join these rooms, sorry.

## Clients

We recommend you to use one of the following clients for the best possible experience, but most should work:

- [Cinny](https://cinny.in): Cinny provides a Discord-like UI and some really nice features. You can use it on the web or as a Tauri app, and it works on Linux phones very well.
- [FluffyChat](https://fluffychat.im): FluffyChat is made with flutter, so it has great cross-platform support, so it's usable on iOS, Android, Linux, Web, etc. It also has some features that Cinny doesn't, but Cinny is slightly more intuitive in my opinion.

## Bridges

Federated Nexus hosts multiple "bridges" and "puppets", to let you talk to people on other platforms from Matrix:

- [Out of Your Element](https://gitdab.com/cadence/out-of-your-element) (OOYE, Discord bridge): You can control OOYE via its web UI: https://ooye.federated.nexus. From this intuitive web UI, Discord server admins can log into their Discord account, and easily set up a bridged Matrix space using the "Easy mode" option. Or, for the more advanced users, they can use the "Self-service" option to manually control the bridge, rather than creating a whole new Matrix space.
- [mautrix-gmessages](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/gmessages/index.html) (SMS puppet): You can use mautrix-gmessages to bridge SMS chats over to Matrix, including both reading and sending SMS. You can set it up for yourself with [their instructions](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/gmessages/authentication.html).
- [mautrix-whatsapp](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/whatsapp/index.html) (WhatsApp puppet): With mautrix-whatsapp, you can bridge your WhatsApp chats to Matrix, in a very similar way to the SMS bridge. See [their instructions](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/whatsapp/authentication.html) for setup.
