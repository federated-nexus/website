[Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) is a free and open-source git forge. Very lightweight and performant, Forgejo is a good replacement for GitHub. We host Forgejo at at https://git.federated.nexus.

## Signing In

To log in, press the "Sign in" button on the top right corner and select "Sign in with Federated Nexus" - it should take you to the Federated Nexus login page, where you can enter the credentials for your Federated Nexus account.

You should then be greeted by the explore page:

## Viewing Your Dashboard

To view your dashboard, press the icon in the top left corner.

The dashboard shows you the recent activity of repositories you watch, a contribution graph, and a list of repositories you are a member of:

## Next Steps

We recommend taking a look at the [Forgejo User Guide](https://forgejo.org/docs/v12.0/user/) for more detailed information on using your Forgejo account.

Forgejo has many useful features you can use, such as:

- Watching repositories to get notified when the repository has any activity
- Forking repositories
- Issue tracking
- An API which allows you to perform automated actions on repositories (such as commenting test results on pull requests)
