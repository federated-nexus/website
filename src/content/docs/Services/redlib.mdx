Redlib is a fast, open source, privacy respecting frontend for Reddit. It lets you browse subreddits, view posts, and read commentsâ€”all without JavaScript, tracking, or ads. Unlike the official Reddit site, Redlib doesn't nag you to log in, install an app, or accept cookies. You can access our instance at https://redlib.federated.nexus.

## Features

Redlib provides a clean, fast, and private way to browse Reddit. It supports many themes and settings, works well on both desktop and mobile, and makes it easy to view posts, preview media, and read comment threads without any ads, tracking, or JavaScript.

## Automatic Redirection

If you'd like to automatically use Redlib whenever you visit Reddit, you can install the [LibRedirect](https://libredirect.github.io) browser extension. LibRedirect detects when you open a site like reddit.com and redirects you to a privacy-respecting alternative, which in this case is our Redlib instance.

Once installed, just open the LibRedirect settings, select "Reddit" in the Service dropdown, and select **Redlib** in the "Frontend" dropdown. Then, under "Add your favorite instances", enter `https://redlib.federated.nexus`, and hit "+". That's it, you're done!
