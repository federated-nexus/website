LaSuite Docs is a free and open source alternative to Google Docs, designed for seamless real-time collaboration. You can find it hosted at https://docs.federated.nexus.

You have a homepage with your documents, and documents that are shared with you:

And of course, the actual editor, where you can compose documents in a GUI similar to Google Docs, and export as DocX or PDF.

You can also add subdocuments!
