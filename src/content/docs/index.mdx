    <Card title="Private and Free Communications" icon="comment">
        Federated Nexus hosts a free [Matrix](https://matrix.org) instance, using the [Grapevine](https://grapevine.computer.surgery/) software. Matrix is an open-source communications platform, allowing you to chat to communities of your choice. We also host multiple matrix bridges, including a Discord bridge, a WhatsApp puppet, and even an SMS puppet! [Learn More...](/services/matrix)

        We host a free instance of [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) at [git.federated.nexus](https://git.federated.nexus)! Forgejo is an open source git forge, that (unlike GitHub) will never train an AI on your code ðŸ™ƒ. [Learn More...](/services/forgejo)

    	[Redlib](https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib) is a free and open source alternative frontend for Reddit, designed to strip out tracking, ads, and distractions. You can browse posts, read comments, and subscribe to subredditsâ€”without the bloat or spyware. [Learn More...](/services/redlib)

    <Card title="Friendly and Inclusive Community" icon="heart">
        We aim to maintain a friendly, diverse, and inclusive community. As part of this I'm not afraid to hoist the ban hammer against any bigoted, homophobic, or otherwise unfriendly people. We follow the [Contributor Covenant](/code).
    </Card>

    <Card title="More Coming Soon" icon="approve-check">
        We still have a fair bit of room on the Federated Nexus servers, so we're open to hosting any useful new software. Let us know in our [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#community:federated.nexus)!
