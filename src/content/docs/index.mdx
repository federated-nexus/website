    <Card title="Private and Free Communications" icon="comment">
        Federated Nexus hosts a free [Matrix](https://matrix.org) instance,
        using the [Grapevine](https://grapevine.computer.surgery/) software.
        Matrix is an open-source communications platform, allowing you to chat
        to communities of your choice. We also host multiple matrix bridges,
        including a Discord bridge, a WhatsApp puppet, and even an SMS puppet! [Learn More...](/services/matrix)

        <Card title="Open Source Collaborative Editing" icon="document">
            LaSuite Docs is a free and open source alternative to Google Docs,
            designed for seamless real-time collaboration. You can compose
            documents in a GUI similar to Google Docs, and export as DocX or
            PDF. You can also add subdocuments, and share links to others, even
            those without an account. [Learn More...](/services/docs)
        </Card>

    <Card title="Fast & Private Search Made Simple" icon="magnifier">
        We run a [SearXNG](https://searxng.org) instance that allows you to log
        in using your Federated Nexus account and perform fast, privacy-focused
        searches across the web—completely free from tracking, profiling, or
        intrusive advertising. [Learn More...](/services/searxng)
    </Card>
    <Card title="A Fast and Free Home for Your Code" icon="seti:git">
        We host a free instance of [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) at
        [git.federated.nexus](https://git.federated.nexus)! Forgejo is a free
        and open source git forge, that (unlike GitHub) will never train an AI
        on your code. 🙃

    <Card title="Friendly and Inclusive Community" icon="heart">
        We aim to maintain a friendly, diverse, and inclusive community, come
        join us! But be aware, I'm not afraid to hoist the ban hammer against
        any bigoted, homophobic, or otherwise unfriendly people.
    </Card>
    <Card title="More Coming Soon" icon="approve-check">
        We still have a fair bit of room on the Federated Nexus servers, so
        we're open to hosting any useful new software. Let us know in our
        [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#community:federated.nexus)!
