        Federated Nexus hosts a free [Matrix](https://matrix.org) instance,
        using the [Grapevine](https://grapevine.computer.surgery/) software.
        Matrix is an open-source communications platform, allowing you to chat
        to communities of your choice.
    </Card>
    <Card title="All Your Chats in One App" icon="document">
        Federated Nexus currently hosts multiple matrix bridges, including a
        WhatsApp puppet and a Discord bridge in progress! We are open to hosting
        more bridges / puppets, as long as they have an available nix package
        (ideally a nix module too).
    </Card>
    <Card title="Fast & Private Search Made Simple" icon="magnifier">
        We run a [SearXNG](https://searxng.org) instance that allows you to log
        in using your Federated Nexus account and perform fast, privacy-focused
        searches across the webâ€”completely free from tracking, profiling, or
        intrusive advertising.
    </Card>
    <Card title="A Fast and Free Home for Your Code" icon="seti:git">
        We host a free instance of [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) at
        [git.federated.nexus](https://git.federated.nexus)! Forgejo is a free
        and open source git forge, that (unlike GitHub) will never train an AI
        on your code. ðŸ™ƒ
    </Card>
    <Card title="Friendly and Inclusive Community" icon="heart">
        We aim to maintain a friendly, diverse, and inclusive community, come
        join us! But be aware, I'm not afraid to hoist the ban hammer against
        any bigoted, homophobic, or otherwise unfriendly people.
    </Card>
    <Card title="More Coming Soon" icon="document">
        We still have a fair bit of room on the Federated Nexus servers, so
        we're open to hosting any useful new software. Let us know in our
        [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#community:federated.nexus)!
